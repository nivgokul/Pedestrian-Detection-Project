## Pedestrian Detection Project

The Python project aims to develop a pedestrian detection system using OpenCV to analyze a recorded video feed. The system will utilize computer vision techniques and pre-trained models to identify pedestrians in the video frames and visualize their locations using bounding boxes.



Key Features: The project will incorporate the following key features:

Video Input: The system will process a recorded video feed as the input source, allowing users to analyze pedestrian detection on pre-recorded footage.

Pedestrian Detection: OpenCV's pre-trained models, such as Haar cascades or HOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients), will be employed to detect pedestrians in each frame of the video.

Bounding Box Visualization: Detected pedestrians will be highlighted using bounding boxes, indicating their positions in the video frames.

Real-Time Processing: The project will process the video frames in real-time, providing near-instantaneous feedback on pedestrian detection.

Adjustable Parameters: The system will offer adjustable parameters to optimize the detection process, including sensitivity thresholds or confidence levels, ensuring flexibility for various scenarios.

Performance Metrics: The project can include the calculation of pedestrian count, allowing users to analyze the flow of pedestrians throughout the video.

Visualization: The detected pedestrians and bounding boxes will be visually represented on the video frames, enhancing the clarity of the detection results.


### Result

The following images show the detection taking place on a pre-recorded video feed of pedestrians.
