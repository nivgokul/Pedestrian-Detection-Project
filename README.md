# Pedestrian-Detection-Project
The Python project aims to develop a pedestrian detection system using OpenCV to analyze a recorded video feed. The system will utilize computer vision techniques and pre-trained models to identify pedestrians in the video frames and visualize their locations using bounding boxes. The main libraries used are OpenCV, imutils, and numpy.
